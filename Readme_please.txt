Respected Dmitry Khanin.
I apologize for this subproject.
Due to problems with COVID-19,I dropped out of your study plan for more than a month,
but I intend to make it of course, at least for my future resume, and gain invaluable experience thanks to your efforts.
Once again I ask you to excuse me for THIS.
